# sm-js
Javascript library for dealing with StepMania simfiles.

Currently a WIP. I made this for my future projects, but feel free to contribute or use it for your own projects.

You can play around by editing the test.js file. Put your favorite simfile in the folder and run `node test.js`. (Remember to set the correct path to your simfile.)

`.sm` file is recommended at this stage. `.ssc` has newer features but I haven't tested them out yet.

README will be updated soon.
